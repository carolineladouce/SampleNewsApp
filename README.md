This is my implementation of the [Swift: Build News App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2IfBdxjWs4) tutorial published by iOS Academy (Thanks Afraz!) 

What I learned:
- How to make an HTTP networking request using URLSession and URLSessionDataTask

This project was a great refresher for:
- Decoding data from a response 
- Rendering a TableView populated with data 
- Setting the TableView's appearance
